Eye Disease Treatment Prediction:

This project focuses on predicting whether a patient with eye-related health conditions should undergo surgery or opt for medical treatment, 
using a binary classification approach. The process includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, implementation of various machine learning models, 
and performance evaluation using robust validation methods.
